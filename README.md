To that aim the repository has several issues marked with labels such as 'help wanted', 'good first patch' or 'hacktoberfest'. 
Issues marked with these labels are a good place to start contributing - you are welcome to contribute to any of these, any other issue, or even submit your own issues or pull requests.

To get an idea of the general status in relation to the launch of the track, check out [issue #8](https://github.com/exercism/c/issues/8)
