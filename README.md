Exercism problems in C

## Contributing Guide

Please see the [Exercism contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md) for general contribution tips.

## Coding Style

All test and example code should be written using the [Linux kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html) with 3 space indents and no tabs.

If GNU `indent` is installed, this can be run on all files by executing `indent.sh`. On a Mac you can install the package `gnu-indent` using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

To manually run it on a single file, you can execute:

```shell
indent -linux -i3 -nut $(file)
```

If your system does not support the `-linux` option, you can run the long form command instead:

```shell
indent -nbad -bap -nbc -bbo -hnl -br -brs -c33 -cd33 -ncdb -ce -ci4 -cli0 -d0 -di1 -nfc1 -i3 -nut -ip0 -l80 -lp -npcs -nprs -npsl -sai -saf -saw -ncs -nsc -sob -nfca -cp33 -ss -il1 $(file)
```

See the [GNU `indent` manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/indent/manual/indent.html#SEC4) for more information.

## Exercise Anatomy

Each exercise should be contained in a directory ```c/exercises/<my exercise>``` with ```<my exercise>``` referring to the name of the exercise.  The structure of the directory is as follows:

```
+-- <my exercise>
    +-- makefile
    +-- src
    |   +-- example.c
    |   +-- example.h | <my exercise>.h
    +-- test
        +-- test_<my exercise>.c
        +-- vendor
            +-- unity.c
            +-- unity.h
            +-- unity_internals.h
```

* `test` - contains the test file ```test_<my exercise>.c``` and a ```vendor``` directory containing the test harness [Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity/) from [ThrowTheSwitch](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/#intro-1-section).  ThrowTheSwitch has a decent guide on [getting started with Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/getting-started-with-unity/) should you desire a tutorial.

* `src` - contains the example files ```example.c``` and ```example.h```. These are both skipped by the ```exercism``` cli when downloading to the client, so it is imperative that you do not reference the names of the files in your code. If you need to provide a header file example that is necessary to run your tests it should be named ```<my exercise>.h``` instead.  Please also use [```include```](http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~mcmahon/CS241/c241man/node90.html) guards in your header files. The tests can be run using the [```bin/run-tests```](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/bin/run-tests) script which will rename the ```example.{c|h}``` files accordingly.
