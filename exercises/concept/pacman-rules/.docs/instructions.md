# Instructions

In this exercise, you need to translate some rules from the classic game Pac-Man into C functions.

You have four rules to translate, all related to the game states.

> Don't worry about how the arguments are derived, just focus on combining the arguments to return the intended result.

## 1. Define if Pac-Man eats a ghost

Define the `can_eat_ghost` function that takes two arguments (_if Pac-Man has a power pellet active_ and _if Pac-Man is touching a ghost_) and returns a boolean value if Pac-Man is able to eat the ghost. The function should return true only if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and is touching a ghost.

```c
can_eat_ghost(false, true);
// => false
```

## 2. Define if Pac-Man scores

Define the `scored` function that takes two arguments (_if Pac-Man is touching a power pellet_ and _if Pac-Man is touching a dot_) and returns a boolean value if Pac-Man scored. The function should return true if Pac-Man is touching a power pellet or a dot.

```c
scored(true, true);
// => true
```

## 3. Define if Pac-Man loses

Define the `lost` function that takes two arguments (_if Pac-Man has a power pellet active_ and _if Pac-Man is touching a ghost_) and returns a boolean value if Pac-Man loses. The function should return true if Pac-Man is touching a ghost and does not have a power pellet active.

```c
lost(false, true);
// => true
```

## 4. Define if Pac-Man wins

Define the `won` function that takes three arguments (_if Pac-Man has eaten all of the dots_, _if Pac-Man has a power pellet active_, and _if Pac-Man is touching a ghost_) and returns a boolean value if Pac-Man wins. The function should return true if Pac-Man has eaten all of the dots and has not lost based on the arguments defined in part 3.

```c
won(false, true, false);
// => false
```
