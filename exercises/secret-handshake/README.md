# Secret Handshake

> There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand
> binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to
binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

```text
1 = wink
10 = double blink
100 = close your eyes
1000 = jump


10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
```

Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

Here's a couple of examples:

Given the input 3, the function would return the array
["wink", "double blink"] because 3 is 11 in binary.

Given the input 19, the function would return the array
["double blink", "wink"] because 19 is 10011 in binary.
Notice that the addition of 16 (10000 in binary)
has caused the array to be reversed.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the "Guides" section of the
[C track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/c) on the Exercism site. This covers
the basic information on setting up the development environment expected
by the exercises.


## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development][3-tdd-rules].

The included makefile can be used to create and run the tests using the `test`
task.

    make test

Create just the functions you need to satisfy any compiler errors and get the
test to fail. Then write just enough code to get the test to pass. Once you've
done that, move onto the next test.

[3-tdd-rules]: http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd

As you progress through the tests, take the time to refactor your
implementation for readability and expressiveness and then go on to the next
test.

Try to use standard C99 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.
