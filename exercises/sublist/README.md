# Sublist

Given two lists determine if the first list is contained within the second
list, if the second list is contained within the first list, if both lists are
contained within each other or if none of these are true.

Specifically, a list A is a sublist of list B if by dropping 0 or more elements
from the front of B and 0 or more elements from the back of B you get a list
that's completely equal to A.

Examples:

 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4, 5], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3], A is equal to B
 * A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], B = [2, 3, 4], A is a superlist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is not a superlist of, sublist of or equal to B

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the "Guides" section of the
[C track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/c) on the Exercism site. This covers
the basic information on setting up the development environment expected
by the exercises.


## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development][3-tdd-rules].

The included makefile can be used to create and run the tests using the `test`
task.

    make test

Create just the functions you need to satisfy any compiler errors and get the
test to fail. Then write just enough code to get the test to pass. Once you've
done that, move onto the next test.

As you progress through the tests, take the time to refactor your
implementation for readability and expressiveness and then go on to the next
test.

Try to use standard C99 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
