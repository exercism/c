# Word Count

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each _word_ in that phrase.

For the purposes of this exercise you can expect that a _word_ will always be one of:

1. A _number_ composed of one or more ASCII digits (ie "0" or "1234") OR
2. A _simple word_ composed of one or more ASCII letters (ie "a" or "they") OR
3. A _contraction_ of two _simple words_ joined by a single apostrophe (ie "it's" or "they're")

When counting words you can assume the following rules:

1. The count is _case insensitive_ (ie "You", "you", and "YOU" are 3 uses of the same word)
2. The count is _unordered_; the tests will ignore how words and counts are ordered
3. Other than the apostrophe in a _contraction_ all forms of _punctuation_ are ignored
4. The words can be separated by _any_ form of whitespace (ie "\t", "\n", " ")

For example, for the phrase `"That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!", cried the Special Agent.\nSo I fled.` the count would be:

```text
that's: 1
the: 2
password: 2
123: 1
cried: 1
special: 1
agent: 1
so: 1
i: 1
fled: 1
```

- Note that the tests for this exercise expect the output words to be proper C strings. That is, they should be NUL terminated. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_string_handling

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the "Guides" section of the
[C track][c-track] on the Exercism site. This covers
the basic information on setting up the development environment expected
by the exercises.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development][3-tdd-rules].

The included makefile can be used to create and run the tests using the `test`
task.

    make test

Create just the functions you need to satisfy any compiler errors and get the
test to fail. Then write just enough code to get the test to pass. Once you've
done that, move onto the next test.

As you progress through the tests, take the time to refactor your
implementation for readability and expressiveness and then go on to the next
test.

Try to use standard C99 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.

## Source

This is a classic toy problem, but we were reminded of it by seeing it in the Go Tour.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
