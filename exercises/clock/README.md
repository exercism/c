# Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the "Guides" section of the
[C track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/c) on the Exercism site. This covers
the basic information on setting up the development environment expected
by the exercises.


## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development][3-tdd-rules].

The included makefile can be used to create and run the tests using the `test`
task.

    make test

Create just the functions you need to satisfy any compiler errors and get the
test to fail. Then write just enough code to get the test to pass. Once you've
done that, move onto the next test.

As you progress through the tests, take the time to refactor your
implementation for readability and expressiveness and then go on to the next
test.

Try to use standard C99 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.
