# Help

Make sure you have read the "Guides" section of the [C track][c-track] on the Exercism site.
This covers the basic information on setting up the development environment expected by the exercises.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

If you are struggling with a particular exercise, it is possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.

## Resources

To get help if having trouble, you can use the following resources:

- [StackOverflow][] can be used to search for your problem and see if it has been answered already. You can also ask and answer questions.
- [CPPReference][] can be used to look up information on C concepts, operators, types, standard library functions and more.
- [TutorialsPoint][] has similar content as CPPReference in its C programming section.
- [The C Programming][K&R] book by K&R is the original source of the language and is still useful today.
