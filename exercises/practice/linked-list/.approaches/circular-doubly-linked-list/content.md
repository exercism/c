There are several ways of implementing a [circular doubly-linked list][circular-doubly-linked-list].
This approach adds a `length` field which is initialized to `0` on list creation and updated as nodes are added and removed.

A circular doubly-linked list populated with at least one node does not have `NULL` values for any node's `prev` or `next` fields.

- If there is only one node in the list, its `prev` and `next` fields will point to itself.
- If there are two nodes in a list, node `A` will point to node `B` for both its `prev` and `next` fields.
Likewise, node `B` will point to node `A` for both its `prev` and `next` fields.
- If there are three nodes in a list, node `A`'s `prev` will point at node `C` and node `A`'s `next` will point at node `B`.
Node `B`'s `prev` will point at node `A` and node `B`'s `next` will point at node `C`.
Node `C`'s `prev` will point at node `B` and node `C`'s `next` will point at node `A`.

The only time the list's `head` and `tail` will be `NULL` is when the list is empty.
This is enforced by the `list_create` function.

The `list_count` function returns the value of the list's `length` field.

The `create_node` function is a helper function to handle adding a node.
Whether the node is added to the back or the front of the list, the new node is always placed between the `tail` and the `head` of the list,
so the same implementation for creating the node is used for adding a node to either the front or back.

If it is thought that the most usual case is that the list already has one or more nodes, then the condition can be tested first that the `head` is not `NULL`
(instead of testing first for if the `head` _is_ `NULL`).
If the `head` is not `NULL`, then the new node is "wired up" to have its `prev` be the `tail` and its `next` be the `head`.
Also, the `tail`'s `next` will be the new node and the `head`'s `prev` will be the new node.

If the `head` is `NULL`, then the new node will be the only node in the list, so its `prev` and `next` fields will point at itself,
and it will be both the `head` and `tail` of the list.

The `length` of the list is incremented for the new node, and the new node is returned from the `create_node` function.

The `destroy_node` function is a helper function to handle removing a node.
Whether the node is removed from the back or front of the list, or from somewhere else, the same implementation for removing the node is used.

The removed node's data is saved to be returned at the end of the function.

The removed node's `next` field is assigned to the `next` field of the node _before_ the removed node,
so the node before the removed node now has a `next` pointing at the node _after_ the removed node.

The removed node's `prev` field is assigned to the `prev` field of the node _after_ the removed node,
so the node after the removed node now has a `prev` pointing at the node _before_ the removed node.

```c
node->prev->next = node->next;
node->next->prev = node->prev;
if (node == list->head)
   list->head = node->next;
if (node == list->tail)
   list->tail = node->prev;
```

If the node being removed is either the `head` or the `tail`, then the `head` or `tail` is adjusted accordingly.

The removed node's `prev` and `next` fields are set to `NULL`, the removed node's memory is freed, and the removed node is set to `NULL`.

```exercism/note
Setting the freed pointer to `NULL` is a housekeeping habit to ensure that if the freed pointer is tested for `NULL` later in the function,
it will properly be `NULL`.
That test doesn't happen in the current code, but if the function were ever refactored it might be helpful to have that housekeeping done.
The pointer in the calling code which was passed into the `destroy_node` function is passed by value,
meaning that the address it points to is copied into the function.
Setting the copy of the pointer address to `NULL` has no effect on the original pointer in the calling code.
With its memory freed, the original pointer still retains its address, now pointing to deallocated memory, making it a [dangling pointer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dangling-void-null-wild-pointers/).
```

```c
node->prev = NULL;
node->next = NULL;
free(node);
node = NULL;
list->length--;
if (list->length == 0) {
   list->head = NULL;
   list->tail = NULL;
}
return data;
```

The list `length` is decremented for the removed node, and if there are no nodes remaining, then the `head` and `tail` are set to `NULL`. 

Finally, the removed node's data is returned from the `destroy_node` function.

The `list_push` function sets the list's `tail` to the node returned from calling the `create_node` function.

The `list_pop` function returns the data resulting from passing the list's `tail` to the `destroy_node` function.

The `list_unshift` function sets the list's `head` to the node returned from calling the `create_node` function.

The `list_shift` function returns the data resulting from passing the list's `head` to the `destroy_node` function.

The `list_delete` function sets a `node` variable to the list `head`.
The `while` loop will iterate if the `node` variable is not `NULL`.
If the `head` is already `NULL`, then the list is empty, the loop will not execute, and no node will be deleted.

```c
void list_delete(struct list *list, ll_data_t data)
{
   node_t *node = list->head;
   while (node) {
      if (node->data == data) {
         destroy_node(node, list);
         break;
      }
      if (node->next == list->head)
         break;
      node = node->next;
   }
}
```

Inside the `while` loop, the data for the `node` variable is tested against the data passed into the function.
If the values match, then `destroy_node` is passed the `node` variable, and `break` is used to exit the loop.
If the values don't match, then the `node`'s `next` field is checked for being the `head`.
If so, then the looping has gone "full circle" and the loop is exited without having found a node with matching data.
If the `next` field is not the `head`, then `node` is set to its `next` node, and the loop iterates again.

The `while` loop in the `list_destroy` function will iterate if the `length` of the list is greater than `0`.
If the `length` is already `0`, then the list is empty, the loop will not execute, and no node will be destroyed.

```c
void list_destroy(struct list *list)
{
   while (list->length > 0) {
     list_pop(list);
   }
   free(list);
   list = NULL;
}
```

Inside the `while` loop the `list_pop` function is called on the list until the `length` of the list is `0`.

Once the `while` loop is done, the list is freed and set to `NULL`.
