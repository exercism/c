This approach starts by defining the maximum expected length of the output string returned from the `translate` function, based on the test input.

A space is defined as the delimiter between words.
Then vowels are defined both without and with a `y`.

```c
#define MAX_PHRASE_LEN 32
static const char DELIMITERS[] = " ";
static const char *VOWELS = "aeiou";
static const char *VOWELS_Y = "aeiouy";

static bool process_vowel_start(const char *word, char *output)
{
   if (strchr(VOWELS, *word) != NULL || strstr(word, "xr") == word ||
       strstr(word, "yt") == word) {
      strncat(output, word, MAX_PHRASE_LEN - (strlen(output) + 2));
      strcat(output, "ay");
      return true;
   }
   return false;
}
```

The `process_vowel_start` function takes pointers to the `word` string and the `output` string .
The [`strchr`][strchr] functon is used to check if the first character of the `word` is in the `VOWELS` string.
Dereferencing `word` (`*word`) will return the `char` currently being pointed to, which in this case is expected to be the first character.
If the return from `strchr` is not `NULL`, then the logical OR (`||`) [short-circuits][short-circuit] as `true`, and the word and `ay` are concatenated
to the `output` string.

The [`strncat`][strncat] function is used to concatenate to the `output` to ensure we don't attempt to write past the end of the output string.

```exercism/note
For a discussion of why `strcat` is used instead of `strncat` to append a string of known size (e.g. `"ay"`), see this
[StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53408543/strncat-wformat-overflow-warning-when-using-gcc-8-2-1).
```

If the `word` does not start with a vowel, then the [`strstr`][strstr] function is used to check if the `word` starts with `xr` or `yt`.

- For example, if the word is `"xray"`, then `strstr(word, "xr")` will return a pointer at the beginning of `word`.
- If the word is `"boxroom"`, then `strstr(word, "xr")` will return a pointer, but it won't be equal to the pointer at the beginning of `word`.
- If the word is `"else"`, then `strstr(word, "xr")` will return a `NULL` pointer, which is not equal to the pointer at the beginning of `word`.

If the `word` starts with either `xr` or `yt`, then the `word` and `ay` will be concatenated to the `output` string.

If the `word` was concatenated to the `output` string, then the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

The `process_vowel_y` function takes pointers to the `word` string and the `output` string .
A `char` array for the word suffix is defined, and the first character is initialized as a null character,
making it an empty string.
The first character of `word` is concatenated to the suffix.

The `for` loop creates another pointer to the `word` and initializes it to point at the second character (`word + 1`).
The loop will iterate as long as the `cur_word` is pointing to a non-`NULL` character.
The dereference of `*cur_word` returns `true` if the pointer is not currently pointing at a null character (`'\0'`), otherwise it returns `false`.

```c
static void process_vowel_y(const char *word, char *output)
{
   char pig_suffix[MAX_PHRASE_LEN + 1] = { 0 };
   strncat(pig_suffix, word, 1);
   for (const char *cur_word = word + 1; *cur_word; cur_word++) {
      if (strchr(VOWELS_Y, *cur_word) != NULL) {
         if (*cur_word == 'u') {
            if (*--cur_word == 'q') {
               strncat(pig_suffix, ++cur_word, 1);
            }
            ++cur_word;
         }
         strncat(output, cur_word,
                 MAX_PHRASE_LEN - (strlen(output) + strlen(pig_suffix) + 2));
         strcat(output, pig_suffix);
         strcat(output, "ay");
         return;
      }
      strncat(pig_suffix, cur_word, 1);
   }
   strncat(output, pig_suffix, MAX_PHRASE_LEN);
}
```

The `strchr` function is used to check if the `char` currently pointed at is in the `VOWELS_Y` string.
If so, and the current `char` is a `u`, then the pointer is decremented to see if the previous character is a `q`.
If the previous `char` was a `q`, then the pointer is incremented back to point to `u`, and the `u` is concatenated to the suffix.

- If the word is `quick`, then the pointer is now at `u` and is desired to be at `i`.
- If the word is `bug`, then the pointer is now at `b` and is desired to be at `u`.
Testing for `q` in `bug` moved the pointer to `b`, and since it was not preceeded by `q` it was not incremented back to `u`.

So, for both situations, the pointer is incremented again: from `u` to `i` for `quick`, or from `b` to `u` for `bug`.

Concatenation for any vowel is the same.
The word from the `char` currently pointed at until the end of the word is concatenated to the `output` string.
Then the first part of the word (now in the suffix string) before the current `char` is concatenated to the `output` string.
Finally, `ay` is concatenated to the `output` string, and the function returns.

- For example, `"quick"` would be `"ickquay".
- `"bug"` would be `"ugbay"`.
- `"boxroom"` would be `"oxroombay"`.

If the current `char` is not a vowel, then it is concatenated to the suffix string and the pointer is incremented.

After the loop is done, if no vowel was found, then the suffix, which is now the whole `word`, is concatenated to the `output` string as is.

The `translate` function takes a pointer to the `input` phrase.

```exercism/note
For production, checks would be made that the pointer is not `NULL` and that allocated memory does not return a `NULL` pointer,
but those and other checks are not made in this approach to keep the implementation simple.
```

The [`calloc`][calloc] function is used to allocate memory for the `output` string.

The [`strncpy`][strncpy] function is used to copy the input phrase into a `char` array that can be iterated with the [`strtok`][strtok] function.
The `strtok` function takes a `char *` input string (not a `const char *` string ) and a string of delimiters to split the input string by the delimiters.
For this, the only delimiter defined is a space.

```c
char *translate(const char *phrase)
{
   char *output = calloc(MAX_PHRASE_LEN + 1, 1);
   char input[MAX_PHRASE_LEN + 1];
   strncpy(input, phrase, MAX_PHRASE_LEN);
   char *word = strtok(input, DELIMITERS);
   bool starting = true;
   do {
      if (!starting)
         strcat(output, " ");
      if (process_vowel_start(word, output))
         continue;
      process_vowel_y(word, output);
      starting = false;
   } while ((word = strtok(NULL, DELIMITERS)));
   return output;
}
```

Inside the `do` loop, if the loop is not starting, then a space is concatenated to the `output` string with the [`strcat`][strcat] function.

If the call to the `process_vowel_start` function returns `true`, then the word starts with a vowel (or `xr` or `yt`) and `continue` is used
to go to the `while` check of the loop.

If `process_vowel_start` returns false, then `process_vowel_y` is called.

The `while` check uses an assignment expression that assigns the `word` variable to the result of calling `strtok`.
By passing `NULL` as the first argument to the `strtok` function, it continues scanning where a previously successful call to the function ended,
as the point where the last token was found is kept internally by the function to be used on the next call.

The `while` evaluates the value of `word` after assigning it to the result of calling `strtok`.
If `word` is not a `NULL` pointer, then the loop will iterate again, otherwise the loop will exit.

When the loop is done, the function returns the `output` string.
