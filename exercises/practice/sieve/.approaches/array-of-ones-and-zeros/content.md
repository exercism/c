      composite[i] = 0;

   size_t output_pos = 0;
   for (uint32_t number = 2; number <= limit; number++) {
      if (!composite[number]) {
         primes[output_pos++] = number;
         if (output_pos == max_primes)
            break;
         for (uint32_t idx = number * number; idx <= limit; idx += number)
            composite[idx] = 1;

}
```

This approach starts by defining the `MAX_LEN` of the array of composite values to be `1001`,
given that the largest length for the result array expected by the tests is `1000`.

```exercism/warning
It would be tempting to set the length of the composite array as a [Variable-length array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_array)
dependent on the value of the `limit`, however, although VLAs were legal in C99, they were made optional in C11,
so compilers that support C11 and later are not required to implement VLAs.
```

The `sieve` function starts by returning `0` if either the `limit` is too small to contain a prime,
or if the number of primes expected back is `0`.

The array of composite values is defined and then initialized with all zeros.

The index for the array of primes is set to `0`.

Since values less than `2` are not prime, the iteration of the `for` loop begins at 2.

If the number being iterated is not a composite number, then that number is set at the current index for the primes array.
`output_pos++` means that the value of `output_pos` is incremented _after_ it is used for indexing into the primes array.

If `output_pos` equals the maximum number or primes expected back, then the calcuating is done and [`break`][break] is used
to exit the `for` loop.
Otherwise, since any multiple of a prime number is not prime, the inner `for` loop iterates from the prime times itself,
setting each of the values at that index to `1` for being a composite number.

After the outer `for` loop is done, the array of primes is returned.
