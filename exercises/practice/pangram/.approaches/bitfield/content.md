The `is_pangram` function starts by using the logical NOT operator (`!`) to check if the pointer to the input is `NULL`.
There is a difference between a `NULL` pointer and a valid pointer pointing to a null character (`'\0'`).

An `int` is defined to keep track of the used letters of the English alphabet.
Since only the rightmost 26 bits will be used, there is no need to have unsignedness.

A `char` is defined for each character to be tested in the loop.

The `while` loop uses an assignment expression for its condition.
The expression `(letter = *sentence)` has the value of `letter` after it has been been assigned the value of the dereferenced `sentence` pointer.
If the value of `letter` is a null character (`'\0'`), then the while loop will not run.
Note that, had the `sentence` pointer not been checked for being `NULL`, then trying to dereference it (`*sentence`) if it were a `NULL` pointer would be undefined behavior.
It likely would result in a segmentation fault.

The [ASCII][ascii] value of the `letter` is compared with a range of ASCII values to check if it is one of the lowercase English letters.

- The ASCII value for `a` is `97`, and for `z` is `122`.
- If the lowercase letter is subtracted by `97`, then `a` will result in `0`, because `97` minus `97` equals `0`.
  `z` would result in `25`, because `122` minus `97` equals `25`.
  So `a` would have `1` [shifted left][shift-left] 0 places (so not shifted at all) and `z` would have `1` shifted left 25 places.
- The [bitwise OR operator][bitwise-or] is used to set the bit at that position in the `phrasemask`.

If the `letter` is not a lowercase English letter,
the ASCII value of the `letter` is compared with a range of ASCII values to check if it is one of the uppercase English letters.

- The ASCII value for `A` is `65`, and for `Z` is `90`.
- If the uppercase letter is subtracted by `65`, then `A` will result in `0`, because `65` minus `65` equals `0`.
  `Z` would result in `25`, because `90` minus `65` equals `25`.
  So `A` would have `1` [shifted left][shift-left] 0 places (so not shifted at all) and `Z` would have `1` shifted left 25 places
- The [bitwise OR operator][bitwise-or] is used to set the bit at that position in the `phrasemask`.

In that way, both a lowercase `z` and an uppercase `Z` can share the same position in the bit field.

So, for a 32-bit integer, if the values for `a` and `Z` were both set, the bits would look like

```

00000010000000000000000000000001
```

The loop increments the `sentence` pointer so it points to the address of the next `char`.
`C` arguments are passed by value, meaning that the actual pointer to the input `sentence` is not passed in, but a copy of the address it's pointing to.
So the address `sentence` points to when passed in can be incremented directly without affecting the original pointer in the calling code.

After the loop completes, the function returns if the `phrasemask` value is the same value as when all `26` bits are set.
The value for all `26` bits being set is `67108863`.
