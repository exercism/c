# How to Implement a C Concept Exercise

This document describes how to implement a concept exercise for the C track.

**Please please please read the docs before starting.** Posting PRs without reading these docs will be a lot more frustrating for you during the review cycle, and exhaust Exercism's maintainers' time. So, before diving into the implementation, please read the following documents:

- [The features of v3][docs-features-of-v3].
- [Rationale for v3][docs-rationale-for-v3].
- [What are concept exercise and how they are structured?][docs-concept-exercises]

Please also watch the following video:

- [The Anatomy of a Concept Exercise][anatomy-of-a-concept-exercise].

As this document is generic, the following placeholders are used:

- `<SLUG>`: the slug of the exercise in kebab-case (e.g. `calculator-conundrum`).
- `<NAME>`: the name of the exercise in snake_case (e.g. `calculator_conundrum`).
- `<CONCEPT_SLUG>`: the slug of one of the exercise's concepts in kebab-case (e.g. `anonymous-methods`).

Before implementing the exercise, please make sure you have a good understanding of what the exercise should be teaching (and what not). This information can be found in the exercise's GitHub issue.

To implement a concept exercise, the following files must be added:

```text
languages
└── c
    ├── concepts
    |   └── &lt;CONCEPT_SLUG&gt;
    |       ├── about.md
    |       └── links.json
    └── exercises
        └── concept
            └── &lt;SLUG&gt;
                ├── .docs
                │   ├── instructions.md
                │   ├── introduction.md
                │   ├── hints.md
                │   └── source.md (required if there are third-party sources)
                ├── .meta
                │   ├── config.json
                │   ├── design.md
                │   └── exemplar.c
                ├── makefile
                ├── &lt;NAME&gt;.c
                ├── &lt;NAME&gt;.h
                ├── test_&lt;NAME&gt;.c
                └── test-framework
```

## Step 1: Add code files

The code files are track-specific and should be designed to help the student learn the exercise's concepts. The following files must be added (not necessarily in this order):

- `makefile`: the makefile for the stub files and tests
- `<NAME>{.c|.h}`: the stub source and header implementation files, which are the starting point for students to work on the exercise.
- `test_<NAME>.c`: the unit test source file.
- `test-framework`: this directory contains the source files of unit test framework, [Unity][unity]
- `.meta/exemplar{.c|.h}`: an exemplar implementation that passes all the unit tests.

## Step 2: Add documentation files

How to create the files common to all tracks is described in the [how to implement a concept exercise document][how-to-implement-a-concept-exercise].

## Step 3: Update list of implemented exercises

- Add the exercise to the [list of implemented exercises][implemented-exercises].

## Inspiration

When implementing an exercise, it can be very useful to look at already implemented C exercises. You can also check the exercise's [general concepts documents][reference] to see if other languages have already implemented an exercise for that concept.

## Help

If you have any questions regarding implementing the exercise, please post them as comments in the exercise's GitHub issue.
