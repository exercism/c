# Introduction

A block is a set of statements and declarations grouped into one syntactic unit.
Blocks are often, but not always, defined within curly braces.
Blocks can be nested within functions and within other blocks.

A function acts somewhat like a block.
An identifier for a variable defined in a function cannot be seen outside the function, just as an indentifier for a variable defined in a block cannot be seen outside the block.
Two variables in two functions can have the same name, since the two functions don't see into each other, just as two variables in two blocks can have the same name, since the two blocks don't see into each other.
But functions and blocks are not identical.
A function cannot be nested inside another function, but a block can be nested inside another block.

In the following example, `number` is defined within the `main` function.
`flag` is defined within the `if` block which is nested within the `main` function.
Variables defined within a block are only valid within that block.
Thus, attempting to compile the code results in a compilation error.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int number = 1;

  if (number == 1) {
      int flag = 1;
      printf("%d", flag);
  }

  // this line generates a compilation error
  // error: 'flag' undeclared (first use in this function)
  printf("%d", flag);
    
}
```

The error message may be confusing, as `flag` _is_ used earlier in the function.
However, `flag` is defined within a block inside the function.
The inner block can "see" the variable `number` in its outer function, but the outer function can't "see" the `flag` variable defined within its inner block.
Once execution leaves the block, the `flag` variable is automatically destroyed and is no longer available to the program.
The `main` function itself sees the `flag` identifier for the first time in the last `printf` statement.
If the last `printf` statement is removed, the program will compile and print `1` when run.
That is because the `flag` variable is valid in the block containing the first `printf` statement.

As of `C99`, single-line `if`, `for`, `while` and `do` statements are also considered blocks.
In the following example, although `i` is not defined within curly braces, it exists only in the block defined by the `for` statement, and is not visible to the outer `main` function.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    for (int i = 0, j = 11; i < j; i+=2)
        printf("%d", i);

    // this line generates a compilation error
    // error: 'i' undeclared (first use in this function)
    printf("%d", i);
    
}
```

If the last `printf` statement is removed, the program will compile and print `0 2 4 6 8 10 ` when run.
Some languages, such as Go and Rust, are explicit that single-line conditional and loop statements constitute a block.
They require that such single-line statements still be enclosed in curly braces.
