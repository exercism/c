# About

Storage-class specifiers relate to how variables are stored in memory.
They are closely related to the storage duration (also referred to as the lifetime) of a value.

## auto (The default storage class for variables)

Since variables defined within a block or function are `auto` by default, it is not common to explicitly use the term.
