# Introduction

A Boolean expression is a question asked of one or more values which can be answered with `true` or `false`.
A true expression returns `1`; a false expression returns `0`.
Also, numbers have true/false values. Zero is `false`; non-zero is `true`. 

Old C code will either use the `int` type directly for Boolean values, or the programmer may have defined constants such as `TRUE` and `FALSE` to map `1` and `0` to a Boolean representation.

With version C99 the `_Bool` type was added.
The `stdbool.h` header file defines three new Boolean symbols: `bool`; `true` and `false`.
`true` maps to `1`; `false` maps to `0`; and `bool` maps to `_Bool`.
So now, instead of directly using `int`s or rolling their own Boolean mappings, programmers can include `stdbool.h` and automatically get Boolean symbols in their code.

## Comparison Operators

C supports six comparison operators: `==` (Equal), `!=` (Not equal), `>` (Greater than), `<` (Less than), `>=`(Greater than or equal to), `<=` (Less than or equal to).
These operators compare the relationships between values and resolve them into boolean values.

```c
0 == 0 // true. Although 0 is false, 0 equals 0 is true.
0 != 0 // false
1 > 0 // true
1 < 0 // false
1 >= 0 // true
1 <= 0 // false
```

## Boolean Operators

C supports three boolean operators: `||` (Or), `&&` (And), and `!` (Not). 

`!` is used with one operand.
It reverses the Boolean value of the operand.
For instance, `0` is `false`, but `!0` is `true`.

`||` and `&&` are used with two operands.
The operand to the right is only evaluated when the operand to the left does not already determine the result of the expression.
That is, `||` only evaluates its operand to the right when its operand to the left evaluates to `false`.
`&&` only evaluates its operand to the right when its operand to the left evaluates to `true`.
