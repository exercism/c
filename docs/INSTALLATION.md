# Installation

The C language track requires that you have the following software installed
on your system:

* A modern C compiler
* The Make build tool

Apple's Xcode IDE combines the compiler and the native build system into a single IDE (integrated development environment).
Linux environments typically expose the compiler and native build system as separate command-line tools.

## Linux

Linux users will need gcc or clang for the compiler, and `make` will be needed for the native build.
Make is pre-installed on most unix systems, but is most likely available via your package manager.
On Debian and Ubuntu based distributions everything you need can be installed with `sudo apt-get install build-essential` if not present.

## MacOS

MacOS users can install gcc or clang with [Homebrew][] via `brew install gcc` or `brew install llvm`.

## Windows

Windows 10 users are recommended to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux][], and proceed with the instruction for linux above.

If you are using an earlier version of Windows or WSL Bash is not available to you, you could use [MSYS][] or [mingw-w64][].
