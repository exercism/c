# Contributing to the C Track

Thank you for interest in contributing to the Exercism C language track! 
All contributions are welcome, be it a new exercise, a change to the tooling or documentation, a raised issue or even just a comment on an existing issue or PR.
This file provides information to help you get started.

Firstly, have a read of the Exercism [docs repository](https://github.com/exercism/docs), specifically the information on [contributing to a language track](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md), as these documents cover a lot of the basic information.

Subsequently note that there are a few things specific to this repository that are explained below.

We encourage contributions that provide fixes and improvements to existing exercises. 
Please note that this track's exercises must conform to the standards determined in the [problem-specifications](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications) repository.
Changes to the tests or documentation of a common exercise will often warrant a pull request in that repository before it can be incorporated into this track's exercises. 
If you're unsure, then go ahead and open a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues), and we'll discuss the change.

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep Exercism welcoming.
Please read and abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Git Workflow

1. Fork and clone.
2. Add this repository as a new remote to your clone: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/exercism/c.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b name-of-branch`
4. Commit and push as usual on your new branch
5. When you're ready to submit a pull request, rebase your branch onto the upstream master so that you can resolve any conflicts: `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/master` You may need to push up to your branch using `--force` after resolving conflicts.
6. When you've got everything ready, push up to your branch and create the pull request as outlined below.

## Issues

We keep track of bugs, enhancements and support requests in the repository using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/exercism/c/issues).

For higher-level discussions about the project as a whole, check out the issues in the [discussions](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues) repository.

### Good First Patch

We're trying to label issues with "good first patch" if we think that these can be solved without too much context about Exercism's codebase or functionality. To find them, you can do a [search](https://github.com/exercism/c/good-first-patch).

## Pull Requests

It would be awesome if you follow these [simple guidelines](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing/pull-request-guidelines.md) while creating your PR, but it isn't required.

Pull requests should be focused on a single, issue or change.
We welcome changes to code style and wording but please open a separate PR for these changes if possible.
Please open an issue before creating a PR that makes significant (breaking) changes to an existing exercise or makes changes across many exercises. It is best to discuss these changes before doing the work.

If your change is to an exercise you can run the CI scripts before submitting the pull request, or they will be automatically run after, as described in [Continuous Integration & Tests](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#continuous-integration--tests) 

When submitting a pull request, sometimes we will ask you to make changes before we accept the patch.

Please do not close the first pull request and open a second one with these changes.
If you push more commits to a branch that you've opened a pull request for, it automatically updates the pull request.

If you want to create a PR with changes that aren't quite ready to be merged to master yet (maybe you would like to discuss some particular item, for example), create the PR as normal but add `[WIP]` to the title so that maintainers know that it isn't quite ready to be merged just yet.

As with adding more commits, you do not need to close your pull request and open a new one if you change the history (rebase, squash, amend), and use git push --force to update the branch on your fork. 
The pull request points to that branch, not to specific commits.

## Coding Style

The code style expected for code change contributions is explained in the [style guide](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/docs/C_STYLE_GUIDE.md).

The exercise code is checked during [CI](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#continuous-integration--tests) for conformance to the spacing and indentation style rules. 
The check uses the GNU `indent` CLI tool.
When adding or making a change to an exercise, you can check that your change conforms to these rules by running the tool locally before committing.

On Linux `indent` should be available for install via your distribution's package manager. 
On a Mac you can install the package `gnu-indent` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Indent can be run on all files by executing `indent.sh`.
To manually run it on a single file, you can execute:

```bash
indent -linux -i3 -nut $(file)
```

If your system does not support the `-linux` option, you can run the long-form command instead:

```bash
indent -nbad -bap -nbc -bbo -hnl -br -brs -c33 -cd33 -ncdb -ce -ci4 -cli0 -d0 -di1 -nfc1 -i3 -nut -ip0 -l80 -lp -npcs -nprs -npsl -sai -saf -saw -ncs -nsc -sob -nfca -cp33 -ss -il1 $(file)
```

## Exercise anatomy

Each exercise should be contained in a directory `c/exercises/<my exercise>` with `<my exercise>` referring to the name of the exercise. 
The structure of the directory is as follows:

```
+-- <my exercise>
    +-- makefile
    +-- src
    |   +-- example.c
    |   +-- example.h | <my exercise>.h
    +-- test
        +-- test_<my exercise>.c
        +-- vendor
            +-- unity.c
            +-- unity.h
            +-- unity_internals.h
```

* `test` - contains the test file `test_<my exercise>.c` and a `vendor` directory containing the test harness [Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity/) from [ThrowTheSwitch](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/#intro-1-section).
ThrowTheSwitch has a decent guide on [getting started with Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/getting-started-with-unity/) should you desire a tutorial. The layout of the test file is described in the [style guide](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/docs/C_STYLE_GUIDE.md#test-file-layout).

* `src` - contains the example files `example.c` and `example.h`. These are both skipped by the `exercism` CLI when downloading to the client, so it is imperative that you do not reference the names of the files in your code. 
If you need to provide a header file example that is necessary to run your tests it should be named `<my exercise>.h` instead.
Please also use [`include`](http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~mcmahon/CS241/c241man/node90.html) guards in your header files. 
The [tests](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#what-are-the-ci-scripts) can be run using the [`bin/run-tests`](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/bin/run-tests) script which will rename the `example.{c|h}` files accordingly.

## Continuous Integration & Tests

The repository uses Travis CI to run some scripts on each commit to a pull request. 
The simplest way to run these scripts on your own contribution is to open a PR on this repository with your changes, edit the PR title to add `[WIP]` then allow this repository's CI setup to take care of things for you automatically.

### Run CI on Your Own Fork

If you would like, it is also possible to run Travis on your own fork. 
The good folks at fish-shell have [some great information](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#travis-ci-build-and-test) to help you get started with setting up Travis on your own fork.

### Run CI Scripts Locally
You can also run individual scripts on your own machine before committing. 
Firstly make sure you have the necessary tools installed (such as `indent`, [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), [`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html), [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [`valgrind`](http://valgrind.org/) and a C compiler), and then run the required script from the repository root. For example:

```bash
~/git/c$ ./bin/run-tests
```

### What Are the CI Scripts?
You can see from the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/exercism/c/blob/master/.travis.yml) file that Travis is instructed to run scripts from the [`./bin`](https://github.com/exercism/c/tree/master/bin) directory. 
The work these scripts perform is described as follows:

- `fetch-configlet` just fetches the `configlet` tool from its [repository](https://github.com/exercism/configlet).

- `configlet` is a tool, specific to Exercism, that performs some repository management tasks. 
The command for `configlet` used by Travis is [`lint`](https://github.com/exercism/configlet/blob/master/README.md#lint). If `configlet` finds any issues Travis will output the details and report a failure on the related PR.

- `verify-indent` runs `indent` and verifies that it did not result in any file changes. 
If the check does result in file changes, Travis will output the details and report a failure on the related PR.

- `run-tests` loops through each exercise, prepares the exercise for building and then builds it using `make`, runs the unit tests and then checks it for memory leaks with `valgrind`.
If there are build errors, any test fails or there is a memory leak, Travis will output the details and report a failure on the related PR.
